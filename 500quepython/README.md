### 6. What are the limitations of Python?  

Despite its advantages, Python has some limitations:  

- **Slower Execution Speed** – Since Python is an interpreted language, it runs slower than compiled languages like C or Java.  
- **High Memory Consumption** – Python uses more memory due to its flexible data types and dynamic typing.  
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** – Python’s GIL restricts multi-threaded execution, making it less efficient for CPU-bound tasks.  
- **Not Ideal for Mobile Development** – Python is not commonly used for mobile applications due to performance concerns.  
- **Limited Database Access** – Python’s database access layers are not as robust as those in Java or C++.  
- **Weak in Multi-Core Processing** – Due to GIL, Python struggles with parallel processing in multi-core CPUs.  
- **Dependency Management** – Managing dependencies in larger projects can be complex compared to languages like JavaScript with Node.js.  

While Python is powerful, these limitations should be considered when selecting it for a project. 🔍

### 7. What are literals in Python?  

Literals in Python are fixed values assigned directly to variables or constants. They represent data without requiring computation. Python has different types of literals:  

#### 1. **String Literals**  
Represent text enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.  

```python
single_quote = 'Hello'
double_quote = "Hello"
triple_quote = '''Hello, this is a multi-line string
```

### 2. Numeric Literals
Include integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

```
integer_num = 10         # Integer literal
float_num = 3.14         # Float literal
complex_num = 3 + 4j     # Complex literal
```
### 3. Boolean Literals
Represent truth values: True or False.

```
is_python_easy = True
is_java_better = False
```
### 4. Special Literal
Python provides a special literal None to indicate the absence of a value.

```
no_value = None
```
5. List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set Literals
Collections of data in different formats.

```
list_literal = [1, 2, 3, "Python"]     # List literal
tuple_literal = (10, 20, 30)           # Tuple literal
dict_literal = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}  # Dictionary literal
set_literal = {1, 2, 3, 4}             # Set literal
```
Literals make code more readable and easy to understand. 🚀
