### 7. What are literals in Python?  

Literals in Python are fixed values assigned directly to variables or constants. They represent data without requiring computation. Python has different types of literals:  

#### 1. **String Literals**  
Represent text enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.  

```python
single_quote = 'Hello'
double_quote = "Hello"
triple_quote = '''Hello, this is a multi-line string'''
```

### 2. Numeric Literals
Include integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

```python
integer_num = 10         # Integer literal
float_num = 3.14         # Float literal
complex_num = 3 + 4j     # Complex literal

```
### 3. Boolean Literals
Represent truth values: True or False.

```python
is_python_easy = True
is_java_better = False
```
### 4. Special Literal
Python provides a special literal None to indicate the absence of a value.

```python
no_value = None
```
### 5. List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set Literals
Collections of data in different formats.

```python
list_literal = [1, 2, 3, "Python"]     # List literal
tuple_literal = (10, 20, 30)           # Tuple literal
dict_literal = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}  # Dictionary literal
set_literal = {1, 2, 3, 4}             # Set literal
```
Literals make code more readable and easy to understand. 🚀

### 8. What is PEP 8, and why is it important?

**PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)** is the official style guide for writing Python code. It provides guidelines to improve the readability, consistency, and maintainability of Python programs.

#### 🔹 **Why is PEP 8 important?**
- ✅ **Improves Readability** – Ensures code is easy to read and understand.
- ✅ **Encourages Consistency** – Helps developers follow the same coding conventions.
- ✅ **Enhances Collaboration** – Makes it easier for teams to work on the same codebase.
- ✅ **Industry Standard** – Many companies and open-source projects follow PEP 8.

#### 🔹 **Key PEP 8 Guidelines**
1. **Indentation** – Use **4 spaces per indentation level**.
   ```python
   def greet():
       print("Hello, World!")  # 4-space indentation
   ```
Maximum Line Length – Keep lines ≤ 79 characters for better readability.

```python
message = "This is a long line, but it should ideally be within 79 characters."
```
Blank Lines – Use 2 blank lines between top-level functions and classes.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

def my_function():
    pass
```
Naming Conventions:

Use snake_case for variables and functions.

Use CamelCase for class names.

Use ALL_CAPS for constants.

```python
class MyClass:
    MY_CONSTANT = 100  # Constant
    
    def my_function(self):  # Function name
        my_variable = "Hello"  # Variable name
```
Imports – Keep imports at the top of the file and use separate lines.

```python
import os
import sys
```
Whitespace Usage – Avoid unnecessary spaces in expressions.

```
# ✅ Correct:
x = (a + b) * (c + d)

# ❌ Incorrect:
x = ( a+b ) * ( c + d )
```
Use Docstrings – Write docstrings to explain modules, classes, and functions.

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

```

### 9 . What is an interpreted language?  
An **interpreted language** is a programming language where the **code is executed line by line** by an **interpreter** instead of being compiled into machine code before execution. This means that the program does not need a separate compilation step, making development and debugging faster.



#### 🔹 **How Does an Interpreted Language Work?**  
1. The **interpreter** reads the source code **line by line**.  
2. Each line is **translated into machine code** and executed immediately.  
3. If an error is found, execution stops at that line (instead of compiling the entire program first).  

**Example: Running Python Code Directly**


python my_script.py
Unlike compiled languages like C or Java, **Python does not require a separate compilation** step before execution.

#### 🔹 Interpreted vs Compiled Languages
| Feature |	Interpreted Language (Python) |	Compiled Language (C, Java) |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Execution | 	Line by line  | Whole program at once |
| Speed	    |Slower (extra translation step)|	Faster (precompiled)|
|Debugging	|Easier (stops at the error line)	|Harder (must recompile)|
|Portability	|More portable (runs anywhere with an interpreter)	|Must be compiled per system|
|Examples	|Python, JavaScript, Ruby	|C, C++, Java
##### 🔹 Examples of Interpreted Languages
✅ Python – Uses the Python interpreter (CPython, PyPy).
✅ JavaScript – Runs inside web browsers (Chrome’s V8 engine).
✅ Ruby – Uses MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter).
✅ PHP – Runs on web servers with Zend Engine.
 
##### 🔹 Advantages of Interpreted Languages
✔ Cross-platform – Code runs on any system with an interpreter.
✔ Faster development – No need to compile before execution.
✔ Easier debugging – Errors are detected at runtime.

##### 🔹 Disadvantages of Interpreted Languages
❌ Slower execution – Extra step of translating code at runtime.
❌ Higher resource usage – Uses more memory and CPU compared to compiled languages.

- Python as a language is not interpreted or compiled. Interpreted or compiled is the property of the implementation. Python is a bytecode(set of interpreter readable instructions) interpreted generally.
- Source code is a file with .py extension.
- Python compiles the source code to a set of instructions for a virtual machine. The Python interpreter is an implementation of that virtual machine. This intermediate format is called “bytecode”.
- .py source code is first compiled to give .pyc which is bytecode. This bytecode can be then interpreted by the official CPython or JIT(Just in Time compiler) compiled by PyPy.

---
### 10. What is the difference between a compiled and an interpreted language?  

Programming languages can be classified into **compiled** and **interpreted** languages based on how their code is executed.



#### 🔹 **Compiled Language**  
A **compiled language** translates the entire source code into machine code **before execution**. The resulting executable file can run independently **without requiring the original source code**.  

🔹 **How it Works:**  
1. The compiler converts the entire program into machine code.  
2. The generated executable file can run multiple times without recompilation.  
3. Compilation must be done separately for different operating systems.  

🔹 **Examples of Compiled Languages:**  
✅ C, C++ (Compiled using `gcc`, `clang`, `MSVC`)  
✅ Java (Compiles to bytecode, then interpreted by JVM)  
✅ Go, Rust  

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✔ **Faster execution** (no need to translate at runtime)  
✔ **More optimized code** (compilers optimize performance)  
✔ **Better security** (source code is not needed to run the program)  

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Slower development cycle** (compilation required before execution)  
❌ **Less portability** (compiled code is specific to an OS/architecture)  




#### 🔹 **Interpreted Language**  
An **interpreted language** executes code **line by line at runtime** using an **interpreter** instead of compiling it beforehand.  

🔹 **How it Works:**  
1. The interpreter reads and translates code **one line at a time**.  
2. Execution stops immediately if an error is encountered.  
3. The same code can run across different systems **without recompilation**.  

🔹 **Examples of Interpreted Languages:**  
✅ Python (CPython, PyPy interpreters)  
✅ JavaScript (Chrome’s V8 Engine, Node.js)  
✅ Ruby, PHP, Bash  

🔹 **Advantages:**  
✔ **Faster development** (no need to compile before running)  
✔ **Platform-independent** (runs on any OS with an interpreter)  
✔ **Easier debugging** (stops at the error line)  

🔹 **Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Slower execution** (each line is translated on the fly)  
❌ **More resource-intensive** (needs an interpreter at runtime)  

---

#### 🔹 **Comparison Table**  

| Feature              | Compiled Language (C, C++) | Interpreted Language (Python, JS) |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Entire program at once   | Line by line (runtime)          |
| **Speed**          | ⚡ **Faster** (precompiled) | 🐢 **Slower** (extra translation) |
| **Portability**     | ❌ OS-specific binary | ✅ Runs on any system with an interpreter |
| **Debugging**       | Harder (must recompile after fixing errors) | Easier (stops at the error) |
| **Example Usage**   | System programming, high-performance apps | Scripting, web development |



### 🎯 **Conclusion**
- **Use compiled languages (C, C++, Rust)** when you need **high performance** and optimized code.  
- **Use interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript)** when you need **flexibility, cross-platform support, and faster development cycles**. 🚀

### 11. How to check the Python version on your system?  

To check which version of Python is installed on your system, you can use the **command line (terminal, CMD, or PowerShell)**.



#### 🔹 **Check Python Version in Command Line**  
Run the following command:  

```sh
python --version
```
---
### 12. What are keywords in Python?  

**Keywords** in Python are **reserved words** that have **predefined meanings** and **cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers**. They are an essential part of Python's syntax and help define the structure of the language.



#### 🔹 **List of Python Keywords**  
Python has a set of built-in keywords. You can view them using the following command in Python:

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```
##### Example output Python(3.10)
```python
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 
'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 
'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 
'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 
'while', 'with', 'yield']


```
##### Examples of keyword usage in python
```python
# Using 'if', 'elif', 'else' (Conditional statements)
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Output:
# x is greater than 5

# Using 'for' and 'in' (Looping)
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2

# Using 'def' to define a function
def greet():
    return "Hello, Python!"
print(greet())

# Output:
# Hello, Python!

# Using 'class' to define a class
class Animal:
    pass

# No output (class is just defined)

# Using 'try', 'except' for exception handling
try:
    y = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")

# Output:
# Cannot divide by zero!

```

### 13. What is indentation, and why is it important in Python?  

**Indentation** in Python refers to the **spaces or tabs used at the beginning of a line** to define the structure of code blocks. Unlike other programming languages that use curly braces `{}` to define blocks, Python **strictly requires indentation** to determine the hierarchy of statements.



#### 🔹 **Why is Indentation Important in Python?**  
✔ **Defines Code Blocks** – Python uses indentation instead of `{}` to mark code blocks.  
✔ **Enhances Readability** – Proper indentation makes the code easier to read and understand.  
✔ **Prevents Syntax Errors** – Incorrect indentation results in an `IndentationError`.  



#### 🔹 **Example of Correct Indentation**
```python
def greet(name):
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Indented block inside if-statement
    else:
        print("Hello, Stranger!")  # Indented block inside else-statement

greet("Alice")

# Output:
# Hello, Alice!
```
#### 🔹 Example of Incorrect Indentation
```python
def greet(name):
if name:  # ❌ Incorrect indentation
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # ❌ This will cause an IndentationError
else:
print("Hello, Stranger!")  # ❌ Incorrect indentation

```
#### output
```python
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```
#### 🔹 Python’s Indentation Rules
✔ Use 4 spaces per indentation level (recommended by PEP 8)
✔ Be consistent – Do not mix spaces and tabs
✔ Every block must have the same indentation level

🎯 Conclusion
Indentation is not just for code formatting in Python; it is required for defining code structure. Incorrect indentation leads to errors, so following PEP 8 guidelines (4 spaces per indentation level) ensures clean, readable, and error-free code. 🚀

### 14. What is the difference between `==` and `=` in Python?  

In Python, `=` and `==` serve completely different purposes:  

| Operator  | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `=` (Single Equals)  | Assignment Operator – Used to assign values to variables. |
| `==` (Double Equals) | Comparison Operator – Used to check if two values are equal. |



#### 🔹 **Example of `=` (Assignment Operator)**  
The **`=` operator** assigns a value to a variable.  
```python
x = 10  # Assigns 10 to variable x
y = "Python"  # Assigns "Python" to variable y

print(x)  
print(y)

# Output:
# 10
# Python
```

### 15) How can you print without a newline in Python?  

By default, the `print()` function in Python **adds a newline (`\n`) at the end** of the output. To **print without a newline**, use the `end` parameter of `print()`.



#### 🔹 **Example: Printing Without a Newline**  
```python
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")

# Output:
# Hello World
```
✅ The end=" " argument replaces the default newline \n with a space, so the two print() statements output text on the same line

#### 🔹 Example: Printing Multiple Items in a Single Line
```python
print("Python", end=" - ")
print("Programming", end=" - ")
print("Language")

# Output:
# Python - Programming - Language

```
✅ Here, end=" - " adds a hyphen and space (-) instead of a newline.

#### 🔹 Example: Printing Without Any Spaces or Newlines
```python
print("Hello", end="")
print("World")

# Output:
# HelloWorld

```
✅ Since end="" removes the default newline without adding any space, the words are printed together.

**🎯 Conclusion**
✅ By default, print() adds a newline after printing.

✅ Use print("text", end=" ") to replace newline with a space or any character.

✅ Use end="" to print without any space or newline. 🚀

### 16) What are variables in Python?  

A **variable** in Python is a **named storage location** used to store data. It acts as a container that holds values, which can be changed during program execution.



#### 🔹 **Declaring and Assigning Variables**  
In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. It is dynamically inferred based on the value assigned.

```python
x = 10         # Integer variable
name = "Alice" # String variable
pi = 3.14      # Float variable
is_valid = True # Boolean variable

print(x)      
print(name)    
print(pi)     
print(is_valid)  

# Output:
# 10
# Alice
# 3.14
# True
```

**🔹 Variable Naming Rules**
✔ Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore _
✔ Cannot start with a number (e.g., ```1var``` is invalid)
✔ Can only contain letters, digits, and underscores
✔ Case-sensitive (```myVar``` and ```myvar``` are different)
✔ Cannot be a Python keyword (```def```, ```if```, ```else```, ```etc```.)

**✅ Valid Variable Names**
```python
age = 25
_name = "John"
user123 = "Python"

```
**❌ Invalid Variable Names**
```python
1name = "Alice"  # ❌ Cannot start with a number
my-name = "Bob"  # ❌ Hyphens are not allowed
def = 10         # ❌ Cannot use keywords

```
**🔹 Reassigning Variables**
You can change the value of a variable at any time:

```python
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5

x = "Hello"
print(x)  # Output: Hello
```
✅ Python allows **changing data types** because it is **dynamically typed**.

**🎯 Conclusion**
✅ **Variables store values** that can change during execution.

✅ **Python is dynamically typed**, so variable types are inferred.

✅ **Follow naming rules** to avoid syntax errors. 🚀

### **17. What is Dynamic Typing in Python?**


#### **Definition**

Dynamic typing means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than being explicitly declared. In Python, you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. The interpreter assigns the type based on the value assigned to the variable.


#### **How Dynamic Typing Works**

In Python, a variable can hold different types of values at different times. The same variable can be reassigned to a different data type without any explicit type conversion.


#### ***Example of Dynamic Typing in Python***


```python
x = 10      # x is an integer
print(type(x))  

x = "Hello" # x is now a string
print(type(x))  

x = 3.14    # x is now a float
print(type(x))  
```


Output:


```
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
```


The variable `x` starts as an integer, then becomes a string, and finally a float.


#### **Advantages of Dynamic Typing**



* **Flexibility** – Variables can change types based on assigned values. 

* **Faster development** – No need to declare variable types explicitly. 

* **Memory efficiency** – Python automatically manages memory allocation. 



#### **Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing**



* **Type errors at runtime –** A variable can change type unexpectedly, leading to errors. 

* **Slower execution – **Extra processing is required to determine types at runtime. 



#### Example of a Type Error Due to Dynamic Typing


```
x = "10"  # String
y = 5
print(x + y)  # ❌ TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```


Solution: Convert `x` to an integer before performing addition:


```
print(int(x) + y)  # ✅ Output: 15
```



#### **Conclusion**

Dynamic typing allows flexibility and ease of coding, making Python highly versatile. However, it requires careful handling to avoid unexpected type errors.
